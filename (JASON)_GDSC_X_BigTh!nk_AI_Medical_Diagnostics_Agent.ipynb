        "Welcome! In this workshop, we'll build a smart AI Agent that can:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Chat with a user** to understand their symptoms.\n",
        "2.  **Decide** when it has gathered enough information to move to research.\n",
        "3.  **Use external tools** (like Perplexity's API) to narrow down medical conditions.\n",
        "4.  **Analyze the findings** and the conversation.\n",
        "5.  **Generate a structured report.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like a simplified version of a preliminary medical consultation. But **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** this is for educational purposes ONLY and is NOT a substitute for real medical professionals (yet😉)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is this interesting?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **LLMs as Orchestrators:** We'll see how Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini can evolve beyond only generating text and also *control a workflow*, make decisions, and use tools.\n",
        "* **LangChain & LangGraph:** We'll use these powerful libraries designed to make building complex AI applications easier. LangGraph helps create reliable, step-by-step AI processes through state management.\n",
        "* **Real-world Pattern:** Similar patterns to this one (chat -> gather info -> use tools -> synthesize) are common in many professions, and can be leveraged to automate real jobs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prerequisites:** Gemini and Perplexity API. We'll explain the AI concepts as we go!\n",

Select the secrets option on left-side handle, and add the GEMINI_API_KEY and PERPLEXITY_API_KEY fields, pasting the API keys in the text fields. This saves the API keys to colab and make them accessible to the colab notebook we'll use for our workshop."

        "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **LLMs can orchestrate:** They don't just generate text; they can follow steps, use tools, and make autonomous decisions within a defined structure.\n",
        "* **LangGraph provides structure:** It allows us to build complex, stateful AI workflows reliably by defining nodes (steps) and edges (transitions).\n",
        "* **State is crucial:** Managing the conversation history, intermediate results, and current stage is essential for multi-turn interactions for complex tasks.\n",
        "* **Tools enhance LLMs:** Giving LLMs access to external APIs or functions dramatically increases their capabilities, making them experts at tasks.\n",
        "* **Prompting is key:** Carefully crafted prompts (System prompts, prompts for nodes. tools) guide the AI's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Further Exploration:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Add more tools (e.g., a calculator, a database lookup).\n",
        "* Experiment with different LLMs or prompt strategies on new use cases.\n",
        "* Explore LangSmith for debugging and tracing your graph runs."
